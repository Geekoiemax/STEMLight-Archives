I participated and succeeded in the competition, winning a design prize at the 2024 World finals. However, I found the competition quite inaccessible to independant teams, and so this guide's goal is to give engineers in the competition a helping hand in order to start. The guide is not yet finished, i hope to finish it by September 2025.",
